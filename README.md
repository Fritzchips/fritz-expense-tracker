## Summary

---

This is my first project using React and it was a big leap from vanilla JavaScript. This project utilizes `React Hooks` to modify state as it passes through different parts of the application. `Local storage` is used to save data with the help of `useEffect` hook. This was also my first deployment to `Heroku`, there were some challenges with the set up but it was a great learning experience. Overall I am excited to continue as I dive into more complex React hooks with my next project.
